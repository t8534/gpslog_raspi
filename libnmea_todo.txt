Use Strategy design pattern

1.
Add GetMessage module.
It read data from Ring Buffer and collect NMEA message.
It could check is crc correct.
It should pass first non valid bytes after initiation.
It should be based on the state machine to detect first and last sign 
of message.
It should delivery NMEA Msg into parsers.

2.
Create MCAL serial and srial_raspi driver.

3.
Remove malloc from code.
Check dynamic parsers upload.
Check is any stdlib functions, like strcmp do not use malloc,
and if any, replace it.

4.
Change variable types to uintX_t.

5.
Compile it on the Raspi.

6.
If ready, move to STM uC.

7.
Make unit tests.
